# Explanation for this issue in Justify Align Module :

```python
    # This method can be used to directly apply this formatting
    def apply(self):
        self.apply_current_text_format(self.format_text)
```

The line of code you're looking at is part of a method in the BaseAlignmentFormatter class. This method, apply_current_text_alignment, is designed to apply a specific text alignment function to the currently focused widget in your PyQt6 application, if that widget is a QTextEdit.

The line focused_widget = QApplication.instance().focusWidget() is doing two things:

QApplication.instance() is a static method that returns the current instance of the QApplication object. This object represents the application itself and is typically created at the start of your PyQt6 program. It's responsible for handling various aspects of the application's lifecycle, and it provides access to application-wide settings and features.

focusWidget() is a method of the QApplication object that returns the widget which currently has focus. In a GUI application, "focus" refers to the widget that's currently selected or active, i.e., the widget that would receive keyboard input if the user were to start typing.

So, focused_widget = QApplication.instance().focusWidget() is getting the currently focused widget from the application instance and storing it in the focused_widget variable. This widget is then checked to see if it's an instance of QTextEdit. If it is, the text alignment function is applied to it.

Other problems which may be occurring from your poor packaging structure.
